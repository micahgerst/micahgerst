Hiya! I'm an aspiring data analyst.

## Projects

### Ongoing
Learning C++!

### Completed
***Drosophilia melanogaster* Network Theory Analysis**

As a part of my third year of university, I undertook a network theory-based analysis of open source neuron data from the fruit fly in Python. In this project, I made extensive use of the NetworkX, pandas, and numpy libraries to explore three-node connections in the medulla oblongata region of the fruit fly brain.

**Multi-Armed Bandit Task Analysis**

In the fourth year of university, I statistically analysed a simulated data set from a real experiment using the multi-armed bandit task. I utilised multiple packages, including tidyverse, ggplot2, and afex to support my analysis.
